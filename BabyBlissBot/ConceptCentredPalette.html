<h1>Bliss Palettes - Related Concepts Surrounding Main Concept</h1>
<body>
<p>
	The purpose of the following two Bliss palettes is to show how a Bliss user
	might arrange palettes for their use where a central concept occupies the
	centre of the display and related ideas surround it.  The idea is the
	central concept provides close access to nearby concepts.</p>
<p>
	Note that the central concept is in the eye of the
	beholder.  It is a central concept for a specific Bliss user as they
	conceptulize things, and not based on some text-book arrangment of concepts.
	It may not make any sense to anyone but the Bliss user who created the
	palette.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		The current depth is one, meaning the central concept is surrounded by
		only one set of related concepts.  There could be two sets, three sets,
		or more, if the user finds that arrangement useful.  The second set
		would surround the first, and so on.
	</li>
	<li>
		The current layout is a grid, but need not be.  It could be circular
		or perhaps even a set of concentric rings.
	</li>
