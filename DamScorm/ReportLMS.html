Dynamic Appearance Model - Report on LMS<br>

<p>This document describes the rationale for choosing ADL's LMS for the DAM/SCORM project.<br>
</p>


<h2>Focus of the Project<br>
</h2>


<p>The main focus of this project is transformation of SCORM content in
terms of its appearance.&nbsp; Its goals are very similar to that of
the TILE project.&nbsp; The main difference is that TILE
transformations are user-centric, whereas SCORM's can be
institutionally based.&nbsp; Nonetheless, a transformation is a
transformation regardless of who it is for.<br>
</p>


<p>As such, I expect that much of what is currently done by TILE is
either partially or completely applicable to the DAM. We (the ATRC)
will spend much of our time extending our TILE efforts to satisfy the
requirements of the DAM.&nbsp; And, this is precisely where the bulk of
the effort should go.<br>
</p>


<p>In this light, the LMS is of secondary importance.&nbsp; However,
there is a requirement that the learner interact with the content
(lessons, SCO's, and other assets) using a SCORM-compliant LMS.&nbsp;
In an ideal world, the LMS would simply make requests of TILE for
content, passing it the necessary transformation triggers.&nbsp; TILE
would fetch the content from a repository, transform it according to
the transformation criteria, and send it back to the LMS.&nbsp; The LMS
would then present the result to the user.&nbsp; With this
architecture, in a sense, it does not matter what LMS is used, as long
as it knows how to make requests of TILE.<br>
</p>


<p>In reality, nothing is actually that modular.&nbsp; I suspect that
we will have to both tinker with the LMS and TILE in order to make the
two communicate properly.&nbsp; Indeed, I expect a side result of this
project is an API for TILE to interact with any LMS.&nbsp; But, again,
the focus should not be here; the effort should be the minimum needed
to make TILE and the LMS talk profitably with one another.<br>
</p>


<h2>LMS<br>
</h2>


<p>We should use ADL's LMS for this project.&nbsp; The reasons are:<br>
</p>


<ol>


  <li>It is primarily written in Java, although some parts are ECMAScript.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The programmers working on this project are experienced in Java.&nbsp; This decreases the learning curve.</li>
    <li>The programmers also have some experience with ECMAScript.</li>
    <li>The expectation then, is that any necessary modifications to the LMS should require minimal effort.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>It uses Apache's Jakarta Tomcat.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>TILE uses Tomcat as well.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Again, this decreases the learning curve.</li>
      <li>It likely decreases the amount of effort to construct a TILE/LMS interface.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>It uses Java Server Pages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In contrast, TILE uses Velocity templates.</li>
    <li>There is a learning curve here, but it is minimal.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Although it uses Java, Tomcat, ECMAScript and other
cross-platform technology, it requires a Windows OS and the use of
Internet Explorer.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is primarily an annoyance in terms of debugging and testing.</li>
    <li>It does require at least one Windows machine specifically for
testing.&nbsp; Since there are two developers on the project, it would
be better if there were two test machines.</li>
    <li>Development (writing code, compiling, quick experiments) can proceed on any machine since TILE itself is platform independent.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>ADL's LMS is guaranteed SCORM compliant.</li>
</ol>
