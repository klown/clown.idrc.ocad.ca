<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines the requirements for a SCO to allow the
transformations outlined in the DAM/SCORM/SOW.&nbsp; The SOW has a
table of transformations with a key indicating whether that
transformation is applicable to branding.&nbsp; This document lists
those transformations that were declared as relevant to branding (i.e.,
the "maybe's" have been dropped).&nbsp; For each transformation, there
is a brief description of how TILE handles the transformation, and,
based on that, what requirements there would be for the SCO in order
that we can co-opt the TILE technique.<br>
</p>

<h2>Text Rendering</h2>

<p>This category is meant to group together transformations involving:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>font family</li>
  <li>text size,</li>
  <li>text colour,</li>
  <li>background colour,</li>
  <li>and highlight colour.</li>
</ul>

<p>TILE handles this transformation using CSS, implying that the SCO
must be transformable via CSS.&nbsp; CSS works with only XML and HTML
documents; hence, the SCO must be XML or HTML.&nbsp; Since it is much
easier to style HTML with CSS, and since the point of this project is
to demonstrate transformations, we recommend that the SCO be HTML.<br>
</p>

<p>Also, it's likely that DAM will use XSL for other
transformations.&nbsp; XSL cannot be used with straight HTML (<a title="Web Style Sheets" href="http://www.w3.org/Style#why">W3C</a>).&nbsp;
We
therefore recommend that the SCO be XHTML.<br>
</p>

<p>At the February face-to-face meeting, Peter proposed that all SCOs
be in a neutral
data format, from which
various specific
formats could be generated.&nbsp; Examples of specific formats include
PDF and HTML.&nbsp; The suggested neutral data format was DocBook.&nbsp;
With
respect to a text rendering transformation, DocBook is fine with the
proviso that the transformation will be applied to the XHTML version of
the SCO generated from DocBook.<br>
</p>

<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>
TILE currently does not handle this; neither is there anything in the
acclip to define layout. It is tempting to use CSS
for this as well, but even for simple layouts, a CSS can be daunting.&nbsp; The use of xhtml &lt;table&gt; elements is easier
for more complex layouts.&nbsp; Also, the support for CSS layout
techniques varies between many mainstream browsers and is
sometimes not supported at all; whereas table support is fairly
universal.</p>

<p>In terms of branding, one possibility is
that each brand pre-defines its
own layout, in CSS.&nbsp; In
that case, the CSS is "canned", and the
transformation amounts to choosing the correct institutional branding
layout to use with the SCO at runtime. A branded layout CSS
implementation has the prerequisite that the SCO be in a common data
format with standard CSS 'class' and 'id' attributes defined.  
This
is typically handled using &lt;div&gt; and
&lt;table&gt; elements.&nbsp; That is, the major areas of the document
are declared using &lt;div&gt; and then are positioned by putting those
&lt;div&gt; elements into the correct cells of a table.</p>

<p>
In short, the SCO is either
transformed via CSS or
by transforming a
&lt;table&gt;, or both.   This again requires that the SCO be
XHTML. It also needs its major sections identified clearly using
class and id attributes, and possibly &lt;div&gt; elements.</p>

<p>
If a neutral data format for a
DAM-SCO is decided upon, this format could support (explicitly or
implicitly) a set of various layout constructs in which a layout-XSLT
transformation (and optionally afterwards, a CSS) could be applied. For
example, the data format could support such layout constructs as: header, footer,  menubar,
navigation bar,
logo, sections,
subsections, etc. in which a
'branding' layout-XSLT transformation could be generated and applied to
each DAM-SCO for the given institution at runtime. Some potential data
formats to investigate further would be: XDoc
(<a title="Maven - Maven" href="http://maven.apache.org">http://maven.apache.org</a>),
StyleBook, and DocBook.</p>

<h2>Document (DOM) order</h2>

<p>
TILE does not handle this transformation.&nbsp; There are two ways to
reorder
the DOM, either using code (DOM api manipulations, cf. Xalan), or via
XSLT.&nbsp; The
requirement again is that the SCO be XHTML.&nbsp; Also, the sections to
be reorderd must be clearly identified in the markup.</p>

<p>This transformation is
similar to layout above and, as a result, has the same common data
format prerequisites. It is a technically different transformation from
layout -- layout does <em>not</em> modify
the order of the elements in the document. Layout affects where on
the page the elements are positioned visually.&nbsp; A document order
transformation does change the order of the in the DOM tree, but without
regard to where those elements are positioned visually.  The visual result of
both transformations may, however, be very similar.<br>
</p>
<p>In any case, this transformation entails the restrictions that a SCO
have a DOM representation, and that the parts to reorganize are clearly
marked.<br>

</p>

<h2>Exclusion (Navigation)</h2>

<p>In TILE, this refers to a table of contents that lists topics and allows a user to choose among.&nbsp; Exclusion is the
availability (and visibility)
of those topics.&nbsp; It is important to note that it is at the user's
request whether topics are excluded.<br>
</p>

<p>The table of
contents
is generated from an item hierarchy in the content package
manifest.&nbsp; The excluded topics are based on user preferences
handled by settings outside of the acclip.&nbsp; This
results ultimately in the availability
of some resource or content; in SCORM-speak, the availability of a
SCO.&nbsp; Thus, an excluded topic is an excluded SCO.<br>
</p>

<p>With respect to branding, this amounts to one brand excluding a set
of SCOs referenced from a content package, while another brand excludes
another set of SCOs.&nbsp; The transformation starts with an item
hierarchy and marks items as excluded or included.&nbsp; In short,
there are no requirements vis-&agrave;-vis the SCO, rather the
requirements pertain to the SCO's metadata.&nbsp; The SCO must be
identifiable as one to exclude, and that information resides outside of
the SCO.</p>

<h2>Alternate Content</h2>








With respect to the acclip and TILE, there are a number of alternate content
transformations.&nbsp; Each of these is dealt with in a
sub-section.&nbsp; The transformations are:<br>








<ul>








  <li><a href="#Content_Density">content density</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Content_Views">content views</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Alternatives_to_X">alternatives to visual</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Alternatives_to_X">alternatives to audio</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Alternatives_to_X">alternatives to text</a></li>
</ul>








<h3><a name="Content_Density"></a>Content Density</h3>








<p>Content density is how much each of section of a SCO is visible, where
users can toggle between "expanded" or "collapsed".&nbsp; This is
implemented in TILE using a JavaScript function.&nbsp; The requirement
for the SCO is that potentially 'dense' sections
of its content be
identifiable, and that those sections can be
collapsed/expanded via a JavaScript function. That is, the 'dense'
section must be a
child (or leaf) block-level section.
</p>



<p>In terms of branding, this
transformation would give an institution a particular 'feel' in
displaying large portions of content that have the potential of being
less-densely represented. For example, if an institution implemented
search functionality across all the SCO's they support, the display of
the description of SCO's which matched the given search constraint
could be toggled as follows based on the branding content density
property:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Collapsed:<br>

</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Content_Views"></a>Content Views<br>
</h3>

<p>The acclip allows two values here, namely image intensive, or text
intensive.&nbsp; An image intensive learning object is one that
communicates its message using lots of graphs, pie charts, images, and
so on.&nbsp; A text intensive one uses text, for the most part, to communicate the
same message.&nbsp; The transformation amounts to substituting one for
the other.<br>
</p>

<p>TILE supports a general one-way
image intensive to text intensive transformation by utilizing HTML's
&lt;img&gt; attributes, "alt" and "longdesc." If requested by the user,
TILE substitutes an &lt;img&gt; with a &lt;p&gt; containing the image's
alternative and long description text. This transformation requires
that the &lt;img&gt; provides proper alternative text descriptions as
defined in the <a title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">WCAG 1.0</a>
guidelines of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. Further
investigation will be done on how far this transformation relates to
branding and whether or not  <a title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">WCAG 1.0</a> conformance
is a requirement of a DAM-SCO.
</p>

<p>
The parts of the SCO that are image intensive, for which text is going
to substitute, must be cleary marked, and must have "alt" and "longdesc" attributes.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Alternatives_to_X"></a>Alternatives to X</h3>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>Side bar: acclip alternative content preferences, and what they
mean:</p>

<ul>

  <li>alternative to visual</li>
  <ul>
    <li>audio alternatives to visual material, e.g, audio (spoken) descriptions of the material.</li>
    <li>textual alternatives to graphics, e.g., alt text for images.</li>
    <li>colour avoidance, e.g. for colour blind users.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>alternatives to audio</li>
  <ul>
    <li>text captions for audio sound track.</li>
    <li>sign language for audio.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>alternatives to text</li>
  <ul>
    <li>graphic alternative for text, e.g, stop sign icon instead of
the text "Stop".</li>
    <li>sign language alternative for text.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>








<p>In short, the alternative content in the acclip involves substituting one
mode of communication for another.&nbsp; The acclip <em>does not</em>
handle substitution of content <em>within</em> a
modality.&nbsp; With respect to branding, a standard example of an
alternate content transformation is substituting one logo
for another.&nbsp; That is a within modality transformation, and the
acclip does not deal with this (hence, neither does TILE).&nbsp; This
might indicate a deficiency in the acclip, or that the trigger for
intra-modality transformations lies outside the acclip.<br>
</p>








<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>The requirement for the SCO is that the content to be substituted be
clearly identified, via id attributes, and/or &lt;div&gt; elements, so that
the "alternative content" of those
sections can be swapped in and out.<br>
</p>



<h3>Role of Metadata in Alternate Content Transformation<br>
</h3>

<p>Finally, a word about metadata and its relationship to alternate
content transformations.&nbsp; First, the content package resource
section allows for defining variant
resources.&nbsp; This is a TILE extension to the IMS content package
schema.&nbsp; Each variant resource is associated with a single
resource and
references another learning object.&nbsp; The intended semantics are that one
learning object is a variation of another.&nbsp; The kind of variation
is defined by the variant's meta-data, specifically its /lom/relation
information.&nbsp; As with content package resource variants, TILE uses
an extended vocabulary for the
/lom/relation/kind meta-data.&nbsp; (In fact, the xml machinery used in
TILE to make this work is more complex,
but this description is enough to communicate the jist).&nbsp; Thus,
given that a
resource (SCO) is to be launched, and the user has requested, say, an
audio alternative, then TILE looks for a variant of that resource whose
meta-data states that it is an audio alternative to the main resource.<br>
</p>

<p>I see no reason why a similar sort of technique could not be used
for alternate content substitutions for branding.&nbsp; The
manifest/resource specifies brand variants.&nbsp; The kind of brand is
given in that variant's meta-data (although we might have to modifiy
the vocabulary to /lom/relation/kind for this).&nbsp; <em>Something</em>
tells the system to use brand X; hence, the transformer looks for brand
X variants when grabbing resources from the manifest.&nbsp; The issue
is: what is the <em>something</em>?&nbsp; Acclip? - if so, it's an
extended acclip.<br>
</p>

<p>The requirement for SCOs is that there be variant SCOs, that their
meta-data properly describes the relationship among the variants, and
that the content packages be constructed to list the variants.</p>

<h2>Content Supplements</h2>

<p>
Content supplements are similar to
alternative content but here, the supplementary material cannot
completely replace the original content.&nbsp; An example is text
captions -- by themselves they are only a textual transcript of the
speech on the audio track.&nbsp; They cannot, by themselves, replace
the entire video.</p>




<p>TILE handles supplements in a similar fashion to alternative
content,
but does require some extra machinery to do something with the
supplements.&nbsp; Keeping with the text caption example, given that
captions are available for a video, TILE uses SMIL to dynamically
combine the original video with the caption text, and then then sends
the SMIL markup to the
client instead of the original video.&nbsp; A caveat, however:&nbsp;
this work is still under development with respect to TILE.</p>
<h2>Structure Presentation (Navigation)</h2>

<p>The acclip has a user preference for showing or hiding a table of
contents.&nbsp; TILE views one purpose of the table of contents as allowing
navigation throught the material.&nbsp; The table of contents
both shows where the user is in terms of which SCO they are currently
viewing, as well as allowing them to "jump" among SCO's rather than be
limited by "next" and "previous" links.&nbsp; The table of contents is
built from the item hierarchy in the content package
organization.<br>
</p>

<p>
With respect to branding, one brand may rely heavily on a
"navigation bar" as part of their look and feel, while another brand
finds this less important.</p>


<p>
There are no requirements on the SCO for this kind of
transformation.&nbsp; The table of contents is derived from the content
package, and its visibility from the acclip.</p>


<h2>Structure Navigation</h2>

<p>
This transformation is based on a depth-first vs. breadth-first
traversal preference in the acclip.&nbsp; This determines the
destination of "next" and "previous" links.&nbsp; Given an item&nbsp;
from the content package, and a bread-first traversal, "next" means
going from sibling to sibling in the item tree before descending to the
children of an item.&nbsp; Depth-first uses the same item tree, but
traverses all of an item's descendents first before moving to that
item's sibling.</p>


<p>
Since this is again determined solely by the acclip and a table of contents, there is no requirement on the SCO themselves.</p>
