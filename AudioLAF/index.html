The impetus of this research was to create analternate user interface using the Java Foundation Classes (JFC or &quot;Swing&quot;). One of the features of JFC is its pluggable look and feel architecture -- theability to define the presentation and control of a user interface componentseparate from what that component does.  Furthermore, Swing supports the abilityto plug in multiple look and feels that run concurrently.  The audio look andfeel project is an attempt to explore this architecture and provide an alternatemeans of controlling Swing-based software.  Thus, in addition to the &quot;standard&quot;GUI based interface, the user can control the software using a keyboard only,while receiving auditory feedback as to where they are, within the userinterface, and what they can do.</P><CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"> [<A HREF="sitemap.html">SITE MAP</A>] [<AHREF="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc">ATRC Home Page</A>]</P></CENTER><HR><P><IMG SRC="sunlogo.gif" ALT="Sun Microsystems Logo"></P><P>This research was funded in part by a grant from Sun Microsystems, Inc. </P><HR><P>Copyright (C) 1999 Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University ofToronto.</P><P>Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article is permitted in anymedium, provided this notice is preserved.</P><P>Updated: 1999 Sep 06 JS</P><P>Web site maintained by<A HREF="mailto:clown.scheuhammer@utoronto.ca">Joseph Scheuhammer</A></P></BODY></HTML>
