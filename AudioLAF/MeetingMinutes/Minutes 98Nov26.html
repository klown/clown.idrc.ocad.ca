<H2>Minutes: AudioPlaf Sounds Meeting</H2>
<P>Date:  November 26, 1998</P>
<P>Present:  Anastasia Cheetham, Lake Porter, Jutta Treviranus, Joseph
Scheuhammer<BR>Regrets:  Karen McCall</P>
<P>We discussed some principles that were used/will be used to choose sound
effects.  These represent the base rationale when choosing sounds to represent
different aspects of the UI:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Short in duration, under one second if possible.<BR><EM>Rationale</EM>: 
undesirable to make users wait to receive the information.</LI>
<LI>Real world sounds:  Being &quot;real world&quot; means the sound occurs
naturally in the real world.  A sawing log is an example.  A synthesized &quot;blip&quot;
is not a real-world sound.<BR>  <EM>Rationale</EM>:  desirable to make the
sounds easy to learn and remember.  Real-world sounds should, at least, be easy
to identify, learn, and remember.</LI>
<LI>Metaphorical sounds:  The sound should be &quot;analogous&quot; to that
which it represents.  In some ways this is more important than the &quot;real
world&quot; principle since frequently it is  difficult to find real-world
sounds that represent the UI widget in question.  In that case, the sound should
still bear a close metaphorical relationship to that which it represents.<BR><EM>Rationale</EM>:
 again, desirable to make the sounds easy to learn and remember.</LI>
<LI>The following principle is hard to state precisely.  The sounds should not
be humorous or toy-like, but sound &quot;professional&quot;, grab the user's
attention without being overbearing.<BR><EM>Rationale:</EM>   desirable that
an audio user interface be usable/used, and not thought of as a curiosity.</LI></UL>
<P>We discussed the list sound.  Joseph noted that Dena's original idea was to
have three tones ascending (descending?) in pitch.  The three tones indicated
multiple items.  Their rising in pitch indicated that the items were ordered. 
The current list sound does not do this -- it is multiple tones rising <EM>and</EM>
falling.</P>
<P>We discussed what the tree sound should be.  Jutta suggested that it could
be an extension of the list sound.  First, a single sound is heard to represent
the root of the tree.  This is followed by a couple of sounds to indicate the
branches at the first level.  This is followed by more sounds to indicate the
branches at the next level.  Overall, this sound indicates a structure that has
few items at the top, and a growing number as one goes down.  Still to be
resolved:  how many levels are needed to communicate the &quot;branchiness&quot;?
 What can be done under one second duration?  What is the actual sound?  Tones,
as in the original list sound?  If so, the tones should descend in pitch as one
goes down the levels.</P>
<P>We discussed the general navigation sound.  It was decided that it was too
long and should be shortened.</P>
<P>We discussed the button identifier sounds:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For push buttons, the sound is two tones in quick succession.  (The
activation sound is a short &quot;click&quot;.)</LI>
<LI>For &quot;on&quot; toggle buttons, it is a xylophone rising in pitch.  &quot;Off&quot;
toggle buttons are presented using a xylophone descending in pitch.</LI>
<LI>For &quot;on&quot; radio buttons, it is a whistle(?) rising in pitch.  For &quot;off&quot;
radio buttons, the whistle descends in pitch.</LI>
<LI>For check boxes, it is three tones where the relative pitch of the middle
tone indicates whether the button is on or off (higher=on, lower=off).</LI></UL>
<P>Jutta suggested that of all these buttons, only push buttons actually have
three states:  up (normal), down (depressed), and up again.  Hence, it should be
represented by three tones.  However, it is clear that this same sound cannot be
used both to identify the button as well as provide feed back when the button is
&quot;pressed&quot;.  I guess the middle tone could be higher when the button is
up (identifier), and lower when pressed (activated).  The other types of buttons
have two states at any given time: on going to off or off going to on, and so
should be represented by two tones.</P>
<P>We discussed &quot;warping&quot; to the menu bar.  Joseph explained that the
&quot;wee-woo&quot; sound was meant to convey that focus has leapt up from its
current location and landed on the menu bar.  He also noted that this sound was
the also used when warping to the tool bar.  We decided that there should be a
sound that identifies the menu bar qua menu bar, and that communicating the
warping of focus was not as important.  In a similar vein, there should be
another sound to identify the tool bar.</P>
<P>There was a brief discussion of the submarine ping sound being used as both
a general disabled sound and the identifier for the desktop.  It was decided
that using it for both was confusing, and that there needs to be two different
sounds.</P>
<P>The meeting ended with the following take home exercise:  Menu bar, tool
bar, and desktop are all containers that can be navigated.  One can move about
and select menus on the menu bar.  One can navigate and select tool buttons on
the tool bar.  The desktop can be explored in terms of its windows and icons. 
How do we communicate the &quot;container-ness&quot; of each?  Personal plug:  I
think the submarine ping is good for the desktop.  It suggests that one is
underneath and can rise to the surface by selecting a window or icon.  Note that
the desktop is, in fact, behind/beneath all of its windows and icons.  Is this a
stretch or what?  If the ping is the identifier for the desktop, then we need
another sound effect for disabled controls.</P>
