<H2>Minutes: AudioPlaf Sounds Meeting</H2>
<P>Date:  December 18, 1998</P>
<P>Present:  Anastasia Cheetham, Lake Porter, Karen McCall, Jutta Treviranus,
Joseph Scheuhammer.</P>
<P>Joseph recalled from the previous meeting that Lake was going to look into a
&quot;pachenko&quot; sound effect for trees, and Karen was going to investigate
echo and reverb for containers.  Lake and Karen did not find to time to record
some examples, and will do so at some future time.</P>
<P>There followed a discussion of a &quot;drum&quot; theme for containers. 
Different kinds of containers would be identified by different drum sounds,
e.g., African drum, snare drum, tom-tom, and so so on.  Unfortunately, my notes
are not explicit as to which drum sound effect goes with which container.</P>
<P>We listened to and discussed the sound effects for combo box, namely a list
sound, and an editing sound (the latter for editable combo boxes).  It was
decided that these were ok.</P>
<P>We listened to and discussed the sound effects for progress bar, both in
terms of its identification as well as its update sounds.  The conclusions were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The ID sound effect needs to be more clock-like.</LI>
<LI>The update sound effect is ok.</LI>
<LI>The &quot;done&quot; sound effect should be a &quot;ding&quot; like a
microwave &quot;ding&quot;.</LI></UL>
<P> We listened to the slider sound effects.  It was decided that the xylophone
used for identification was ok, but needed to be quicker.</P>
<P>We reviewed the sound effects for the password entry field.  My notes say,
literally:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ID:  now lock.</LI>
<LI>act:  type writer typed.</LI></UL>
<P>I believe this means that the identifying sound effect for the password
field is now a lock sound, but I can't recall what this sounds like.  A padlock
locking?  A key turning in a lock?  A deadbolt being set?  Does anyone remember?</P>
<P>The second point is clearer:  as the user types in the password, they hear a
type writer &quot;chicka&quot; for every key typed.  Is this correct?</P>
<P>There was a relatively lengthy discussion on the sound effect for a desktop
icon.  This was because none had been previously specified to date.  We came to
the following &quot;principle&quot;; that a desktop icon is really a graphic
proxy for the &quot;real thing&quot;.  Jutta suggested that, within the audio
domain, one could communicate this proxy nature via the sound of a post-it note
being attached (a sort of stick-on sound effect).</P>
