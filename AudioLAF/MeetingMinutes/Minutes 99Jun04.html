<H2>Minutes: AudioPlaf Meeting</H2>
<P>Date:  June 7, 1999</P>
<P>Present:  Anastasia Cheetham, Karen McCall, Tamar Weiss, David Bolter, Jutta
Treviranus, Joseph Scheuhammer.<BR>Regrets:  Lake Porter</P>
<P>The purpose of this meeting was to decide on a set of tasks to perform for
the next meeting, and thereby set an agenda for the next meeting.  This was done
in order to get the ball rolling again.  In addition, the issue of MIDI was
discussed.</P>
<H3>MIDI for Non-Speech Audio</H3>
<P>At the previous meeting, Lake posed the question, can we use MIDI for the
non-speech audio?</P>
<P>Jutta said that she has been playing with MIDI on Macintosh and gives it a
big thumbs-up.  She will mail information to Karen so that Karen and Lake can
look into using MIDI to (re)create the sound effects.</P>
<P>Allen has stated that the version of JMF used in the audio plaf does not
handle MIDI, but that the latest version may.  He will not investigate further
unless given instructions to do so.</P>
<P>David noted that his Cacophony program (the alternative to JMF/JSAPI) would
require modification to use Windows MIDI facilities.</P>
<P>The question then arises as to whether there is a better way to handle MIDI.
 Joseph suggested that he, and perhaps Allen, take a close look a QuickTime for
Java.  The reasons are three-fold:  (1) it is Java programming, (2) QuickTime is
available on Windows and Macintosh, (3) QT handles MIDI very well.</P>
<P>David noted a drawback is that QuickTime is not available on Unix, and no
one knows whether it ever will be.  Joseph replied that currently JMF only runs
on Windows; that we actually gain a platform if going the QT route.  Here is
another thought:  JMF is supposed to handle QT -- in fact, at JavaOne '98, there
was a demo of JMF playing a QT movie on Solaris.  So, if we put the midi in QT
movie files, perhaps JMF will play them, eventually.</P>
