Sometime inthe future, the executable code will be made available, along with some form ofinstaller, so that interested parties can run and evaluate the user interfacefor themselves.  In the interim, a number of pages are provided that documentthe sound sequences presented when the user navigates or activates some aspectof the user interface.  It is hoped that these give a flavour how the audiointerface &quot;looks&quot;.</P><H2>Documentation</H2><P>There are three kinds of documentation to peruse.  There are the userinterface documents, the architecture document, and the bugs/complaintsdocuments.  All are in various stages of completion -- keep in mind that theseare drafts that currently under revision.</P><H3>User Interface</H3><P>There are two parts to the user interface documentation.  The main documentdescribes the design of the audio look and feel.  The second aspect is an entireweb site in itself documenting the translation matrix for each swing component.</P><H4>User Interface Design</H4><P>This is the &quot;why we did it the way we did it&quot; document.  Itdescribes the rationale behind the audio feedback provided when users interactwith the Swing components.  For further edification, read &quot;User InterfaceDesign&quot; (as of this writing, this document is under construction).</P><H4><A HREF="XlateMatrix/ss_contents.htm">Translation Matrix</A></H4><P>A companion piece to the user interface design, the translation matrix is afull specification of the sounds and speeches used for each Swing component. This is &quot;manual&quot; that the programmers used to write the code.  Itsmain page is entitled, &quot;<A HREF="XlateMatrix/ss_contents.htm">Swing SetComponents: Table of Contents</A>&quot;.</P><H4>Keystroke Charts</H4><P>The translation matrix documentation already includes descriptions of thekeystrokes used to navigation and or manipulate Swing components, but it does soon a component-by-component basis.  There are two documents describing keyboardcontrol separate from the audio feedback.  This may suit the reader as a moreconvenient way of perusing them.</P><P>In order to achieve a level of consistency, the same keystroke is used fordifferent components for conceptually similar tasks.  For example, there are anumber of components that can be thought of as grouping a set of members, and itis desired to inspect and navigate among them.  Examples include menus and lists-- menus group together a set of menu items, and lists possess list items.  Thekeystrokes to navigate a menu and a list are the same.  Which is actuallynavigated at any given time depends on which has keyboard focus.</P><P>There are two keystroke charts; one for non-text components, and the otherfor text based components:</P><UL><LI>Keystrokes for <A HREF="Keystrokes.html">non-text components</A>.</LI><LI>Keystrokes for <A HREF="TextKeyStrokes.html">text components</A>.</LI></UL><H4><A HREF="MeetingMinutes/MinutesIndex.html">Rationale Meetings </A></H4><P>There have been a number of meetings regarding the rationale for, and thechoices of, non-verbal audio for the various Swing components.  The minutes ofthese meetings can be found <A HREF="MeetingMinutes/MinutesIndex.html">here</A>.</P><H3><A HREF="Architect.html">Architecture</A></H3><P>This is the &quot;how we did it the way we did it&quot; document.  Itdescribes the implementation of the audio look and feel from a technicalstandpoint.  Read &quot;<A HREF="Architect.html">Audio Look and Feel: Architecture</A>&quot;.</P><H3><A HREF="problems.html">Problems</A></H3><P>These documents describes issues the programmers encountered while writingthe code.  It is made up of bug reports, complaints, and &quot;have youconsidered this?&quot; musings to provide feedback to Sun.  The technologiescovered are Swing, the Java Speech API (JSAPI), and the Java Media Framework(JMF).
