<H2>Component Name: Lists<BR> Lists and ListItem Selection</H2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG></P>
<P>A component that allows the user to select one or more objects. A typical
example is a list of files in a file chooser dialogue. The contents of a list
can be anything. Frequently, it is text, but need not be. It could be a list of
icons. For that matter, it could be a mixture of text and icons.</P>
<P>If the list is large, users can navigate it using a scroll bar.</P>
<P>A feature of lists is their selection model. In some instances, a maximum of
one item can be selected. This would be true for a file chooser dialogue. Other
lists have a multiple selection model, wherein a subset of the list can be
selected at once. An example of this is if the list represented food items
available for purchase, and the user was selecting a group of items. Note that
in this scenario, the selection of an item is distinct from, say, activating the
item. The latter is accomplished by pressing the button labelled &quot;purchase&quot;
after completing the selections.</P>
<P>Any list of items which allows the compuer user selection. Examples are font
styles, document styles, colours (in older applications), filenames and
options/preferences. Illustrated below is a &quot;cutting edge&quot; example of
how a list might be represented in an inventory or retail environment. there is
a list of items from a restaurant menu, pictures of them on the left,
description to the immediate right of the picture and the remainder of the &quot;list
area&quot; is blank, that is until you make a selection (second figure) when the
price pops into view. This is a great challenge for sonification and an
application which is just around the corner.</P>

<P><STRONG>Sound Rationale</STRONG></P>
<P>The sound for a list is that of a harp rapidly going up in scales. This
sound will most likely change if we have time to develop it in a similar manner
to that of a slider. The functions of the two components are similar in that a
list can be navigated/activated either up or down, with the user choosing
elements along the way.</P>

<P><STRONG>First Letter Navigation</STRONG></P>
<P>First letter navigation is implemented for lists/list items.  In this case,
the search is confined to the list items.  When the list has focus, pressing a
key will invoke the search system.  If an item is found, the feedback is the
same as if the user navigated to the item via the navigation keys -- see
<A HREF="lists.htm#itemNav">Navigation</A> above.  Furthermore, the audio look and
feel's notion of &quot;current item&quot; is updated to that item.  Note that
this can alter the selection set depending on how the primary look and feel
responds to moving about the list items.  Finally, if no item matches the
search, nothing in the list is altered, and the generic error sound is played.</P>
<HR>
<H3>List Manipulation</H3>
<P>The audio look and feel allows users to add and remove list items from the
selection set using only key strokes.  This functionality depends on the audio
look and feel's internal tracking of the &quot;current list item&quot;.  As
noted elsewhere in this document, this tracking is done independent of the
primary look and feel.</P>
<P>As users make key strokes to move item-by-item among the list items, they
can at any time add or remove the current item to the selection set, using the
add/remove key strokes.  The feed back sequence is as follows:</P>
<P><STRONG>Activation</STRONG></P>
<OL>
<LI>Required activation sound effect:
<UL>
<LI>If adding,
<A HREF="javascript:playSound('paste.wav' , 'List -- add to selection')">paste.wav</A></LI>
<LI>If removing,
<A HREF="javascript:playSound('cut.wav' , 'List -- remove from selection')">cut.wav</A></LI></UL></LI>
<LI>Required name or label of list item, as speech. &lt;list item label&gt;
[Alternate:  &quot;no label&quot;].</LI>
<LI>Required new state of component, as speech:
<UL>
<LI>If adding, &quot;added to selection&quot;.</LI>
<LI>If removing, &quot;removed from selection&quot;.</LI></UL></LI></OL>
