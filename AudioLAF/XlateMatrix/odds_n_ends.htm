<p><strong>Additional Sounds Incorporated into Swing Set Demo</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong><a HREF="javascript:playSound('disabled.wav' , 'Not Available')">General
Disabled Sound</a></strong>&quot; - This is a sound which is played when an option is not
available. The User Interface Design Team volleyed back and forth between the game show
buzzer used in the NotePad demo and the sumbarine ping which was fianlly decided on.</p>

<p>It was felt that the short sharp buzzer sound was too &quot;abrasive&quot; a way of
letting a computer uer know that something was simply not available, not that they had
done something wrong. The submarine ping is used to reinforce location, let you know there
is something there and if it is not available, you can go back and check it against your
original &quot;where am I and what can I do&quot; position. To the Team it seemed readily
identifiable as a &quot;real woeld sound&quot; that people could relate to.</p>

<p>One note of concern by one of the Team members is that whereever possible the term
&quot;not available&quot; should be used instead of &quot;disabled&quot;. This concern is
semantic and attitudinal in nature. Although the term &quot;disabled&quot; is easy to use
and readily identifiable as something that &quot;doesn't work&quot;, the broader
implications extend toward the way people with disabilitis are viewed by society. The best
example is that tractor trailer that was disabled and blocking traffic, or the highway
ramp that was not available due to a disabled vehicle. &quot;Disabled&quot; means blocking
progress, keeping the masses back, from doing their daily work, and at the very least
getting in the way. We would not think of aying that a francophone, Christian, female (or
any other descriptor) tractor trailer caused traffic problems. How can a society bombarded
with all this prevention of progress, then think of hiring, educating or otherwise
including someone with a disability if that person with a disability is perceived as
blocking progress, preventing work from being done or getting in the way? The concession
to calling the file &quot;disabled.wav&quot; was made for the same reason the term is
widely used, it is shorter and easy to use. Whereever possible, however, the term
&quot;Not Available&quot; or some other descriptor should be used instead.</p>

<p><strong><a HREF="javascript:playSound('backspace.wav' , 'Backspace')">Backspace</a></strong>
- When one gets &quot;fluent&quot; at using a keyboard, or even when one is learning the
keystrokes, it is important to distinguish beween the Backspace and the Enter keys, and
the Backspace and the Delete keys. A simple sound which lets the computer user know that
they have indeed done the Backspace action is an important element of text editing.&nbsp;
In our Demo, a single light, cow-bell sort of sound is used. It is also important for
audio output of exactly what has been Backspaced over!</p>

<p><strong><a HREF="javascript:playSound('delete.wav' , 'Delete')">Delete</a></strong> -
Again, becasue one can easily Delete something while meaning to hit the Enter or Backspace
key, it is important to know what action has been performed. A single simple tone,
sounding like a plug or pop releasing has been used for the Delete sound. Also, the text
that has been deleted should be echoed to the computer user.</p>

<p><strong><a HREF="javascript:playSound('enter_indialog.wav' , 'Enter Key in Dialog')">Enter</a></strong>
- in dialog box only -&nbsp; The User Interface Design Team decided that it is important
to know in a dialog box which keystroke you have done. Traditionally the Tab key and the
enter key perform navigation and activation functions respectively. So, in a dialog box
ONLY, we have assigned a sound for pressing the <a
HREF="javascript:playSound('tab_key_indialog.wav' , 'Tab Key in dialog')">Tab key</a>, and
one for pressing the Enter key. We are not sure if the Swing Set will allow this, but we
included the sounds anyway.</p>

<p><strong><a HREF="javascript:playSound('no_text.wav' , 'No Text')">No Text</a></strong>
- It is also important to know whether there is a chracter, word or sentence before or
after your current position. For example if I am in an Input Field and have Backspaced to
delete text, once I have reached the point where I can't Backspace any further, a sound
should be available to let me know that in cse I lost count of how many characters I have
taken out. I should also know if I have reached the end of my editing, that there are no
more senetences, words or characters. So if I tell my computer to &quot;Read
Previous&quot; and there is no previous item, a sound would give me a clue to this.
Otherwise I am not sure whether the keystroke has worked, my computer has frozern or any
other number of things that could go wrong in a totally speech output dependent system.</p>

<p><strong>Separator</strong>: Not being done</p>

<p>The horizontal line that appears in menus and visually groups related items within a
single menu. It's debatable whether this needs to be sonified. I have heard arguments on
both sides. If we do sonify this, it should be later rather than sooner.</p>

<p><strong><a HREF="javascript:playSound('tooltip.wav' , 'ToolTip')">ToolTip</a></strong>
- using the NotePad demo sound</p>

<p>The little piece of text that pops up when the mouse lingers over a tool bar button,
for example. We have partially sonified this by allowing users ask for the tool tip. But,
nothing has been done in terms of alerting the user when it pops up spontaneously. Should
we do something in this regard?</p>

<p><strong>ToolBar</strong> - done for NotePad project</p>

<p><strong>Labels</strong> are text based components see text elements</p>

<p>A Label is a short piece of static text, or an icon, or both, that labels some other
object. A typically example is a piece of text or icon used to denote the purpose of an
editable text field.</p>

<p>Example of Swing Set Labels</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="labels.jpg" width="400" height="257"
alt="example of swing set labels"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spinners and StringSpinners</strong> see List</p>

<p><strong>ScrolBar and Split Panes</strong> are a totally visual way of perceiving
information and the same result can be achieved by toggling between docuemtns, or
applications. For this reason the User Interface Design Team decided that these components
were not to be done</p>

<p>Used to move about the contents of a window when those contents do not fit entirely
within the viewing area. We did not sonify this in the Notepad demo because I felt that
this widget is truly visual in nature. Rather, we tried to implement meaningful keyboard
navigation of the text without having to actually acquiring and activating a scroll bar</p>

<p><strong>Thumb</strong>: you should be able to ask how far down the document you are;
should be shortcut to tell you cursor position in relation to total document. Not
sonified.</p>

<p><strong>File Chooser</strong> &#150; see List</p>

<p>Below is an example of the Swing Set File Chooser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="file_chooser.jpg" width="400" height="253"
alt="file_chooser.jpg (34121 bytes)"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Colour Chooser</strong> &#150; RGB or Hue? Since there are &quot;official
Pantone colours&quot; for puclishing, and these colours have been translated into HTML
coding, Karen is looking into the possibility that they also might have names so that we
can use the hex-3 percents to generate a &quot;colour name&quot;. It will not allow access
to EVERY colour of the rainbow, but it will enable some use of colour on non-screen based
devices. (this is also the only place where Joseph found a spinner used)</p>

<p>The User Interface Design Team found a chart of Pantone colours used in Desktop
Publishing, and a sort of &quot;standard of colour&quot;, which had been converted into
HTML colour codes. We are still looking for some indication as to whether these colours
have more &quot;common names&quot; which could then be atached to percentages when
achieved in a Colour Chooser.</p>
