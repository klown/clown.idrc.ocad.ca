These functions are also available via themenu system, but are used so often that an explicit, easily reached (via mouse)mode of operation is desired.</P><H3>Sound Rationale</H3><P>There are only a few things a user can do with a tool bar.  One is to movekeyboard focus to it from wherever they are within the user interface.  Thisability to warp directly to the menu bar is cued by a rising-then-falling &quot;wee-woo&quot;sound that is meant to convey that they have left one part of the user interfaceand immediately moved to the tool bar.  Once there, they can move among the toolbuttons themselves, and activate the one they desire to do so.</P><H4>Navigation To the Tool Bar</H4><OL><LI>Required navigation sound effect.<A HREF="javascript:playSound('menuBarNavTo.wav', 'Warp to Tool Bar')">menuBarNavTo.wav</A></LI><LI>Optional disabled sound effect.

If the user activates one of the tool bar buttons,then its activation feedback sequence is given.</P><H4>&quot;Where Am I?&quot;</H4><P>There are, broadly speaking, two places where the user could be with respectto the tool bar -- either at the tool bar itself, or at one of its tool barbuttons.  If the former, then the &quot;where-am-I?&quot; report is simply &quot;toolbar&quot;.  If the latter, then the feedback is &quot;tool bar&quot; followed bythe &quot;where-am-I?&quot; report for the tool bar button with focus. Typically, this is push button, and so the push button &quot;where-am-I?&quot;feedback sequence is given -- see <A HREF="button.htm">Buttons</A>documentation.</P><OL><LI>Optional disabled sound effect.

In this case, thesearch is confined to the tool bar when it has focus.  Pressing a key willinvoke the search; if a menu on the menu bar matches, the feedback is the sameas if the user navigated to that menu via the navigation keys.  Finally, if nomenu matches, a generic error sound is played.</P><H4>Additional Information (Control + shift + E)</H4><P>There is no additional information for the tool bar alone.</P><H4>Tool tip (Control + shift + T)</H4><P>It is assumed that there is no tool tip associated with a tool bar, so thereis no feedback for this keystroke.</P><HR><H3>Leaving Tool Bar</H3><P>Uses can exit the tool bar at any time without having to activate any of itsbuttons.  Keyboard focus will revert to where it was before they warped to thetool bar.  In this case, a special audio feedback sequence is given to indicatethat they have left the tool bar.</P><OL><LI>Navigation sound effect. <A HREF="javascript:playSound('menuBarNavFrom.wav', 'Leaving Tool Bar')">menuBarNavFrom.wav</A></LI><LI>Navigation speech.  &quot;leaving&quot;</LI><LI>Navigation role.  &quot;Tool Bar&quot;.</LI></OL><HR><P><A HREF="ss_contents.htm">Table of Contents</A><BR>   End of file<BR>  Last updated 10 Jun 99</P></BODY></HTML>
