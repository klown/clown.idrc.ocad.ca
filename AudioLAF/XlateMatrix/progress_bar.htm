<h2>Component Name: Progress Bar<br>
States: In Progress, Done</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is used to provide feedback while some other activity is ongoing. For example,
while loading the contents of a file, the progress bar would indicate how much is loaded,
and how much more time will be taken up by the loading operation.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a Swing Set progress bar. In Swing Set you have the option of
starting and pausing/stopping progress. One of the other innovations is that a computer
user can acutally see the document/object as it is loading (something not always available
at the present time)</p>

<p><strong>Sound Rationale</strong></p>

<p>The two sounds associated with this function are very different. While in progress, the
sound is that of a clock or metranome ticking away the time, a constant reminder to the
computer user that something IS happening on their screen and within their application.
The sound is a moderate one, so that the computer user is not frustrated by a sound that
is too fast or too slow.</p>

<p>Once finished, the computer user needs to be able to distinguish the difference between
the actions of &quot;in progress&quot; and &quot;done&quot; so the &quot;done&quot; sound
is again an electronic one, reminiscent of the end of a slide show, a tranistion from one
place to another, sort of &quot;science fiction&quot; based in it's conceptual use! It is
short, but &quot;final&quot; in it's sound.</p>
