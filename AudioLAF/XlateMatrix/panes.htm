<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="#ExternalPane">Component Name: External Pane</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG></P>
<P>An External Pane is similar to an &quot;application window&quot;; it
contains the menu bars, toolbars, scroll bars, status bars, desktop pane and/or
internal panes currently available in that application.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sound Rationale</STRONG></P>
<P>The sound for an external pane is that of a window opening and closing.
Again, the metaphoric and real world sounds combine to create the association
with a window.  The External Pane is the &quot;window&quot; to other documents
and options within an application, like the picture window of a cottage.</P>

<P><STRONG>&quot;Where Am I?&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P>There is no &quot;where am I&quot; feed back for external panes per se. 
Typically, focus is on some component within the window, and that component
intercepts and handles the &quot;where am I&quot; request.</P>
<P><STRONG>Additional Information (Control + shift + E)</STRONG></P>
<P>As with the &quot;where am I&quot; request, the request for additional
information is handled by the component that has focus within the active window.</P>
<HR>
<H3>Component Name: Internal Pane</H3>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG></P>
<P>In essence, this is a window that must appear inside a Swing
<A HREF="panes.htm#DesktopPane">Desktop Pane</A> (which, in turn, appears inside some
External Pane). One might also refer to it as a &quot;document window&quot;.</P>
<P>The Internal Pane is similar to a &quot;child window&quot; whose look can be
defined entirely within Java -- this is a 100 per cent pure Java window. In
contrast, for example, an External Pane (<A HREF="panes.htm#ExternalPane">see above</A>)
is an operating system specific window. Thus, when the Swing Notepad example is
run on Windows 95, it looks and behaves like any other Windows window. If run on
the Mac, it looks like a Macintosh window. In contrast, Internal Panes always
look the same from platform to platform. </P>
<P>Below is a Swing Set example of the three elements related to accessing
information: the Tabbed Pane, the Desktop Pane, and the &quot;floating&quot;
Internal Pane.</P>

<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Sound Rationale</STRONG></P>
<P>From a user's perspective, internal frames and external frames are pretty
much the same thing:  they are windows.  As such, the audio for internal panes
is the same as that used for external panes.  However, more was implemented for
internal panes -- sounds for minimizing and maximizing, as well as activating
and closing.  The minimizing sound effect is that of something deflating; the
maximizing audio is the same as the activation sound effect (a window opening).</P>

</P>

<H3><A NAME="DesktopPane">Component Name: Desktop Pane</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG></P>
<P>Contrary to the term, this is NOT confined the &quot;Desktop View&quot; seen
in a Windows based environment. Although it is a gray area, it can be the first
thing a user looks at when the computer starts, it can be in an External Pane,
Internal Pane, Tabbed Pane; or even a Menu Bar or ToolBar. It is basically a
visual representation of &quot;an empty box&quot; in which internal frames and
desktop icons can be placed.</P>
<P>Computer users, who are using a screen reader, can find themselves in a
Desktop Pane and type for hours with the echo of text and functions merrily
going along...until they go to save and nothing happens.  This is because they
have just spent the last few hours typing into oblivion. A hard lesson! By
sonifying the Desktop Pane, it will act as a failsafe mechanism for computer
users in the event that a screen reader function can echo typing without putting
it into a document. </P>
<P>For an illustration see <A HREF="panes.htm#InternalFramePix">Internal Pane</A>. The
Desktop Pane is the blue area in the Tabbed Pane, surrounding the Internal Pane.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sound Rationale</STRONG></P>
<P>Caught in the traditional use of the concept of a Desktop Pane, the sound is
the same as that used for options not available to the computer user. As
elements are added to a Desktop Pane, their sonification and identification will
be heard, but since a Desktop Pane is like an empty box just waiting for
components to be put into it, using the general &quot;unavailable&quot; sound
seems logical.</P>

<P><STRONG>Activation</STRONG> &nbsp;</P>
<P>The manipulation of the desktop involves the minimizing/maximizing/closing

there is no active window nor selected icon on the desktop.  Here the &quot;where

<P><STRONG>First Letter Navigation</STRONG></P>
<P>First letter navigation is implemented for the desktop.  In this case, the
search is confined to the windows and desktop icons therein.  When the desktop
itself has focus, pressing a key will invoke the search system.  If an window or
icon is found, the feedback is the same as if the user navigated to the item via
the navigation keys.  Finally, if no item matches the search (this includes the
situation where there is nothing on the desktop), a generic error sound is
played.</P>
<P><STRONG>Additional Information (Control + shift + E)</STRONG> &nbsp;</P>
<P>For the desktop, this is a list of all the windows and icons on the desktop.
 The titles of the windows/icons are given, and, in the case of the active
window/selected icon, it is listed as &quot;active&quot;:</P>

<HR>
<H3>Component Name: Tabbed Pane<B></B></H3>
<P>A component which lets users switch between a group of components by
clicking on a tab with a given title and/or icon. The tabbed pane corresponds to
Windows property sheets.</P>
<P>Tabbed panes use a single selection model. That is, one cannot choose or
select more than one tab at a time. The contents of the page accessed via the
tab can be anything from a simple text area to a complicated set of other user
elements<B> </B></P>
<P>For an illustration see <A HREF="panes.htm#InternalFramePix">Internal Pane</A>. The
example given is housed inside a Tabbed Pane.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sound Rationale</STRONG></P>
<P>Since a Tabbed Pane functions in a manner similar to a Menu Bar or a Menu,
that is, providing a series of choices and options that can be &quot;opened&quot;
and &quot;closed&quot;, it was decided that the best approach was to use the
same sound.  The resulting consistency should contribute to the perception of
similar functionality.</P>
