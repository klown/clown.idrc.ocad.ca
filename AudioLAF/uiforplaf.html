E.G. Driving an automobile.</LI><LI> To allow for consistancy of the interface regardless of the platform beingused.  E.G. Components can be identified with the same sound.</LI></OL><H2>Overall Interface</H2><H3>General Philosophy</H3><P>1. The &quot;Look&quot; or method of conveying information to the user iscompletely auditory in nature.  This feedback can be separated into verbalinformation and sounds that are not speech related.  The &quot;Feel&quot; ormethod employed by the user to supply information to the system is exclusivelykeyboard based.</P><P>2. The sounds used in this &quot;Audio Look and Feel&quot; were designedfrom a real world perspective.  The goal was to make the interface as intuitiveas possible.  Real world sounds often prove more memorable, and are moreuniversal so as to lessen the barrier presented by language or culture.</P><P>3. Higher levels of information can be identified throught the interfacewith the same sound.  E.G. Opening a Menu always sounds like a drawer beingpulled open, Lists are always sonified as a group of three descending notes.</P><P>More specific tasks have been matched with sounds that are narrower inscope.  E.G. The action of Cutting text is associated with the sound ofscissors, a request from the system to input data is always associated with ascribble noise...</P><P>4. An effort has been made to minimize the length of sound sequences as wellas the sounds themselves.  Not only is it difficult for the usr to retain largesegments of auditory data, but there were problems getting strings of sounds toflow together. E.G. The sound of a key turning in a lock was initally usedwhenever an action or command was executed, even if that action or command hadbeen matched with its own sound.  The results were less than ideal, and the &quot;keyin lock&quot; sound was dropped except in cases where no other cue confirms thatexecution of a task has been successful.</P><P>5. This interface has been designed with a particular learning strategy inmind.  The sounds have intentionally been placed at the beginning of everysequence, in order that they may act as a guide to the user.  E.G. The user willhear a sound, and the sound will be followed by its verbal match.  It is hopedthat, as users become more comfortable with the interface, they will hear thesound and understand its meaning without needing to hear the verbal portion ofthe sequence.  Ideally, the user will be able to adjust the level of verbalprompting received until it has almost disappeared.  The end result will be amore efficient interface that still provides all of the information the userrequires.</P><P>6. This interface is not meant to function as a screen reader.  Although itwill provide the user with necessary auditory feedback, and can be usedindependently, it does not behave like a text to speech application.  It ishoped that this &quot;Audio Look and Feel&quot; will also be used in conjunctionwith other assistive technology applications, and &quot;Look and Feel's&quot;that concentrate on other sensory modalities.</P><H2>Non-Text Components</H2><H3>General Philosophy</H3><P>1. The components were sonified according to their functionality, and nottheir visual appearance.  E.G. Lists and String Spinners look different, butboth are groups of words or numbers from which the user must select items. Therefore, they have been sonified the same way.  Repetition of sounds wherepossible puts an emphasis on functionality and creates a more memorable andintuitive interface.</P><P>Another example involves the grouping of Radio Buttons, Toggles, andCheckboxes into one category.  The information that the user must be given iswhether or not the component is depressed, active, or checked.  Although thesethings look visually different, their functionality suggests that they caneither be turned on or off.  Melodies were used to indicate the status of eachof these components.  E.G. The melody that identified selection was always thesame, as was the melody that identified non-selection.  The distinction betweenthese three components was the tamber of the tune being played.  In other wordseach was associated with its ownmusical instrument.</P><P>Push Buttons were not included in this category because when Buttons appearthe user must make a choice.  Once this choice has been made, the Button orButtons immediately disappear, and so their status cannot be verified by theuser.  Information about status is dependent upon which of the Buttons wasselected.</P><P>2. The same principle of examining the type of information that the userneeded to receive was employed when the navigation system for the Menubar andMenu Items was designed.  E.G. One keyboard command acts as a toggle to bringthe user onto and off of the Menubar.  However, once a Menu has been opened, theuser is able to move from Menu Option to Menu Option by pressing &quot;CTRL+RIGHT/LEFTARROW.&quot;  In other words, the use is able to move up and down from one levelto another, and left to right within a given level.  Levels include the Menubaritself, the Menu Titles, the level where Menus are opened, and the Menu Optionsthemselves.</P><P>The navigation of Tabbed Panes is similar.</P><P>(See the Enhanced Features section for more information.)</P><P>3. There were components that we felt were too visual to sonify.  It wasconcluded that many of them had been used to solidify concepts through visualmeans.  E.G. Colour, size, location on the screen...  Often, these componentswere examined in terms of their smaller parts, and the kind of information theyconvey.  The primary concern was to include only those pieces of informationthat were relevant to a user who was hearing rather than seeing the interface. E.G. The Desktop Pane was a component that cannot be navigated to or activated. It was broken down in terms of what it contains: internal frames, icons... These components found within the Desktop Pane were matched with sounds, but itwas felt that the user needed additional information.</P><UL><LI>Name of the desktop, if it has any.</LI><LI>Names of its internal frames, and the ability to navigate to them.</LI><LI>Names of its icons, and the ability to navigate to them.</LI><LI>Is it enabled or disabled?</LI></UL><P>This last item is particularly valuable, because if the Desktop Pane is notavailable, a user who is not looking at the screen could input data withoutrealizing that it has nowhere to go.</P><P>Other examples include: the separater, scrollbars, split screen</P><P>resizing...</P><P>4. We decided to break more complicated components down into their simplersub-components.  E.G. A Combo Box is made up of a text field and a drop downlist.  Therefore, when the user encouters a Combo Box the sequence will be: Listsound, Text Field noise - verbal Combo Box label.</P><P>This indicates to the user that this is a List where inputting informationis also possible.</P><H2>Text-Based Components</H2><H3>General Philosophy</H3><P>1. Many of the navigational aspects of the text area employ the same orsimilar keyboard commands as popular commersial screen reading packages.  It ishighly likely that visually impaired users of a future &quot;Audio Look and Feel&quot;will have had considerable experience accessing computers with text to speechsoftware.  These commonalities will decrease the learning curve required forthis interface.  E.G. Read previous and next character, read previous and nextline...</P><P>2. Not all of the possible actions in the text area were matched withsounds.  In certain instances (with colour or fonts) representation with soundis not possible or appropriate.  In other instances (with bold or italics)creating keyboard toggles seemed more logical.  Toggles will allowing the userthe opportunity to obtain information about whether a feature like Bold is on oroff.  If every text attribute were to be sonified, the user would be presentedwith an infinite number of sounds, and would likely be unable or unwilling toretain them all.</P><P>3. The decision was made to sonify some of the more commonly used text-basedcommands.  These can be divided into two categories: navigational commands andthose used to edit text. Navigation - presence of capital letters, cursor atbeginning or end of text, blank lines...</P><P>Editing - cut, copy, paste, forward delete, backspace, toggles on/off...</P><P>Outline Of Enhanced Features</P><P>1. Menus</P><P>Within a given level of the menu system, pressing a key will navigate to thefirst item whose first letter matches. Subsequent such key presses will navigateto the next matching item. The search wraps. &quot;Within a given level&quot;means, that the search is confined to the current level only, e.g., the menubar, or a menu.</P><P>2. Tool bar</P><P>ctrl+t to get to the tool bar.</P><P>ctrl+left arrow to move among the tool bar buttons.</P><P>ctrl+right arrow to move among the tool bar buttons.</P><P>esc to leave the tool bar.</P><P>ctrl+shift+h describes where you are in the tool bar.</P><P>ctrl+shift+t provides a tool tip for a tool bar button.</P><P>Also, once focus is on the tool bar, pressing a key will navigate to thefirst item whose first letter matches. Subsequent such key presses will navigateto the next matching item. The search wraps.</P><P>3. Selected Text</P><P>A keyboard command is available to read the selected text to the user.</P><P>4. Tabbed Pane</P><P>When focus is on the tabbed pane, pressing a key will navigate to the firsttab whose first letter matches. Subsequent such key presses will navigate to thenext matching item. The search wraps.</P><P>5. List</P><P>down arrow to move to the next item in the list.</P><P>up arrow to move to the previous item in the list.</P><P>ctrl+shift+h describes where you are in the list.</P><P>ctrl+shift+e lists the currently selected items, if any.</P><P>Exploration Position and Selections</P><P>ctrl+left arrow to move to the previous item in the list *.</P><P>ctrl+right arrow to move to the next item in the list *.</P><P>ctrl+add to add the current position to the selection(s).</P><P>ctrl+subtract to remove the current position from the selection(s).</P><P>* The &quot;exploration position&quot; is specific to the auditory look andfeel. Users can use ctrl+left and ctrl+right to navigate among the list itemswithout affecting the visual display. In particular, the current selection isunaffected by these navigation key strokes. Furthermore, these key strokesdefine a notion of &quot;current item&quot; from the point of view of theauditory look and feel -- once the user decides to add/remove the current itemto/from the selection, they may do so using the add/remove key strokes. At thatpoint, the selection is updated visually.</P><P>Also, once focus is on the list, pressing a key will navigate to the firstitem whose first letter matches. Subsequent such key presses will navigate tothe next matching item. The search wraps.</P><P>7. Combo Box</P><P>ctrl+left arrow to move and select the previous choice.</P><P>ctrl+right arrow to move and select the next choice.</P><P>ctrl+shift+h describes where you are in the combo box.</P><P>ctrl+shift+r toggles editing/selecting mode *.</P><P>* Toggling between editing and selecting works only for editable comboboxes. If you attempt to toggle a non-editable combo box, you will hear ageneric error sound. When in selection mode, pressing a key will navigate to andselect the first item whose first letter matches. Subsequent such key presseswill navigate to the next matching item. The search wraps.</P><P>The editor in an editable combo box is a text component, and is sonified inthe same way as all other text components (see &quot;TextKeystrokes.html&quot;).</P><P>8. General Navigation and Activation</P><P>In addition to the specific navigation key strokes noted above, keyboardnavigation is accomplished via the default focus manager key strokes, currently.These are tab to move forward, and shift+tab to move backward.</P><P>Activation of a component is accomplished by return. &quot;Activation&quot;means manipulating the component in its normal way. Thus push buttons arepushed, check boxes are changed from checked to unchecked, or from unchecked tochecked, menu's are popped open, menu items are activated, tabs are selected,and so on.</P><P>9. Extra Information</P><P>There is often other information associated with a component. At present,there is a key stroke to speak the following kinds of extra information. The keystroke is ctrl+shift+E.</P><UL><LI> Whether the component has a mnemonic. Mnemonics are shown visually by anunderlined letter. The user description of this is &quot;shortcut key&quot;.</LI><LI> Whether the component has a keyboard accelerator. These typically appearin menu items as right justified text. An example would be &quot;ctrl+X&quot;for a &quot;Cut&quot; menu item. This type of extra information is described tothe user as a &quot;hot key&quot;</LI></UL><P>10.
