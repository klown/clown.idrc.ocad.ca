    <input type="button" value="display:none" onclick="hideByDisplay();"/>
    <p>The above buttons toggle the <code>visibility</code> and <code>display</code> css properties of the 2nd paragraph.  Setting its
    <code>visibilty</code> to <code>hidden</code> leaves a blank space on the page equal to the rendered size of the paragraph.  But, setting its <code>display</code> to <code>none</code> leaves it completely unrendered; that is, there is no blank space.
