<h1>GNOME Shell Demo Script</h1>
<h2>Login</h2>
<P>Remind me to tell you the password.</P>
<h2>Starting GNOME Shell</h2>
<OL>
	<LI>Start a “Terminal”:
</OL>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI>Locate the “Screen” icon on
		the horizontal bar going across the top of the screen (the
		so-called gnome panel). 
		<LI>Click it once. 
		<LI>At the prompt, type: “gShell
		&lt;ret&gt;” 
		<LI>Move the mouse to the desktop and
		wait until it changes from the “busy cursor” state back to an
		arrow. This may take a while; don't panic. 
		<LI>If you want to, you can minimize this window, but do <EM>not</EM>
		close it. 
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>Note: to exit GNOME Shell, put focus on this terminal window and
press &lt;cntl+c&gt;. This should take you back to the standard
desktop environment. 
</P>
<h2>Launch Magnifier Preferences Dialog</h2>
<P>Note:  You should not launch this dialog before launching GNOME
Shell because the “Docked” screen position is handled using D-Bus
(service), not Gsettings (preferences).  The magnifier D-Bus service
is initialized during the launch of the GNOME Shell.  It must be
running so that the preference dialog can discover the service.</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Locate the “Magnifier
	Preferences” short cut on the right of the desktop. 
	<LI>Double-click it. It should come up
	as a Window titled “Magnifier Preferences”. 
	<LI>Demonstrate turning Magnfier on and off with “Zoom” radio
	buttons. 
        <UL>
            <LI>Should come up full screen, proportional mouse tracking,
            lens mode off, and no crosshairs. 
        </UL>
	<LI>Demonstrate the various Mouse Tracking modes. 
	<UL>
		<LI>End with “Proportional”. 
	</UL>
	<LI>Demonstrate the various Screen positions. 
	<UL>
		<LI>Avoid “Docked” for now, end with “Full Screen”. 

	</UL>
	<LI>Demonstrate magnification factor. 
	<LI>Switch to “Docked”. 
	<LI>Turn on lens mode.
	<UL>
		<LI>Show interaction with different
		mouse tracking modes. 
		<LI>Centred and Proportional immediately move the lens. Push
		only moves the lens when at edge of magnified view.
	</UL>
	<LI>Switch to one of the half-screen positions. 
	<UL>
		<LI>This is a way to show how larger lenses. 
	</UL>
	<LI>Turn lens mode off.
	<LI>Switch to full screen.
	<LI>Demonstrate various crosshairs settings.
	<UL>
		<LI>The reason for crosshairs is to
		make it easier to locate the mouse cursor.
		<LI>The reason for crosshairs clip is to make it easier to (1)
		see the mouse cursor, and (2) see text that is immediately below
		the mouse.
	</UL>
	<LI>Turn magnifier off using Zoom Off
	radio button.
	<LI>Prep for running Orca -- end with these preferences:
	<UL>
		<LI>Proportional mouse tracking, 
		<LI>Full Screen, 
		<LI>Magnification factor of 2.0, 
		<LI>Moveable lens disabled, 
		<LI>Scrolling at screen edges
		disabled, 
		<LI>Crosshairs enabled. 
		<LI>Crosshairs clip enabled. 
		<LI>Blue crosshairs (#0000FF) 
		<LI>Any opacity (but 0.5 is nice). 
		<LI>Any length.
		<LI>Thickness 16 pixels.
	</UL>
</UL>
<h2>Launch Orca</h2>
<OL>
	<LI>Go to “Activities” button in top left of screen.
	<LI>Type “Orca” return.
	    <UL>
	        <LI>Orca should start up.
	        <LI>Be patient, as it takes a while.
	        <LI>Orca has a very simple main window with three buttons:  “Preferences”, “Quit”, “About”, and “Help”.
	 Focus should be on the “Preferences” button.
	    </UL>
	<LI>Launch Orca Preferences.
	    <UL>
	        <LI>Click the “Preferences” button, or press space (assuming Preferences has focus).
	        <LI>Orca's (rather large) preferences dialog should appear, but, again, it takes a while.
	     </UL>
	<LI>Focus should be on the  “General” Tab.
	    <UL>
	        <LI>Either arrow right or click the “Magnifier” Tab.
	    </UL>
	<LI>Demonstrate these settings:
</OL>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI>Left side of panel:
		<UL>
			<LI>Enable magnifier checkbox.
			<LI>Scale factor spinner.
			<LI>Position popup
		</UL>
		<LI>Right side of panel, vertically towards the centre:
		<UL>
			<LI>Enable cross-hair checkbox.
			<LI>Enable cross-hair clip checkbox.
			<LI>Cross-hair size spinner (size means thickness here, not
			length).
			<LI>Cross-hair colour.
		</UL>
		<LI>Note that all of these are modified using D-Bus.  They
		change the magnifier behaviour, but do not affect the preferences. 
		You will not see changes reflected in “my” Magnifier
		Preferences dialog.  In particular, if you disable the crosshairs
		using Orca and either close its preferences dialog or quit Orca
		entirely, then you have to change crosshairs thickness in the
		Magnifier Preferences dialog to make them visible again.
	</UL>
</UL>
<OL START=6>
	<LI>Exit Orca's preferences dialog.
</OL>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI>Click “OK” in the bottom right area.
		<LI>This button may not be on screen since the window is very
		wide, and the Touchpad has a small screen.  Move the window to the
		left.
		<LI>Orca (very) briefly turns off the magnifier.  And, It takes
		a verrry long time for the dialog to close.
	</UL>
</UL>
<h2>Open Office + Orca + Magnifier</h2>
<P>This is a really good demonstration of focus tracking.  You should
do this using just the keyboard.</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Make sure the crosshairs are enabled with crosshairs clipped
	also enabled.
	<LI>Find the icon named “Text Test File.odt” on the bottom
	left of the desktop.
	<LI>Double click it; OpenOffice should launch.
	<LI>Focus should come up in the (empty) document at the text
	input cursor, and it should be automatically placed within view.
	<LI>Start typing.  If you type enough, then the magnified view
	should shift leftwards to keep the text caret at or near the centre
	of the view.
</OL>
<OL START=7>
	<LI>Hit &lt;alt&gt; to go to the menu bar.  The view should shift
	to the “File” menu.
	<LI>Navigate the menu bar using left/right arrow keys.  The view
	shifts such that the highlighted menu is at or near the centre of
	the magnified view.
	<LI>Open the “File” menu by navigating to it and then using
	the down arrow key.
	<LI>Navigate the “File” menu.  The view shifts such that the
	highlighted menu item is at or near the centre of view.
	<LI>(Optional)  Press &lt;esc&gt; twice to first close the menu,
	and then to leave the menu bar.  The focus returns to the input
	caret.
	<LI>Use the keyboard to navigate to the “File – Exit” menu
	item.  Press return to quit OpenOffice.
	<LI>A “Do you want to save your changes” dialog appears, with
	keyboard focus on the “Save” button.
	<LI>Tab to the “Discard” button and press space.  This should
	quit without saving.
</OL>
<P>One final note:  I almost never demonstrate the "Scroll at screen edges" checkbox in the Magnifier Preferences dialog.  It only works with centred mouse tracking.  I just discovered a new user for it, however:  Due to the small size of the Touchpad screen, it is sort of useful to see when you are at or beyond the edge of the screen.</P>
