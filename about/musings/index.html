The collection of documents here is the outcome of scratchingthat itch.  In all honesty, the frequency with which I publish somethinghere is low; but check back to see if there is anything to your fancy.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><p>Here is a list of links to the documents, and a brief description of each:</p><dl>  <dt><a href="W4A/index.html" title="Web-4-All Smartcard Project">Web-4-All</a></dt>  <dd>  <p>Web-4-All is a project sponsored by Industry Canada, a ministry of  the government of Canada. Industry Canada has its own web site describing Web-4-All, but, to me,  it describes the web service end of the project more than the client side. The majority of my work  on the project has been on the smartcard/work-station end. So, I thought I would write up <a href="W4A/index.html" title="Web-4-All Smartcard Project">a brief  description</a> of that end of things.</p>  </dd>  <dt><a href="FormContent/index.html" title="Accessibility, Form, and Content">Accessibility, and Separating Form from Content</a></dt>  <dd>                       <p>This truly is a musing, in the sense that I wrote it on a whim. Eventually, it was presented    at the      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/DIAWorkshop/statements.html" title="W3C DIA Workshop - Position Statements and Papers">        W3C's October, 2000 workshop on web device independent authoring      </a>.    Gregory Rosmaita presented it on my behalf (thanks again Gregory!).    </p>    <p>On the other hand, this is remarkably old news -- haven't you heard yet? If not, here are the    main points of the message:</p>	<ol>	<li>HTML is <em>not</em> a formatting language.</li>	<li>You should use style sheets to handle formatting.</li>	<li>If you do, you will make your web pages more accessible.</li>	</ol>	<p>That's the short of it. <a href="FormContent/index.html" title="Accessibility, Form, and Content">Read the whole paper</a> for the long of it.	</p>   </dd>  <dt><a href="Events/index.html" title="Events">Events</a></dt>  <dd>                       <p>This began as a presentation, on behalf of the ATRC, for one of itscoporate partners.  The partner wanted an explanation of user interfaceevents and their role. I volunteered to talk about two eventsystems, namely Java's, and the Macintosh model (by now the <em>Classic</em> Macintosh).I started with the Java event system, and then decided that was enough.</p>                       <p>As I reached the end of my notes on Java events, I noticed a new themeemerging.  That theme was that even though events, such as mouse clicks,key presses, and so on, are triggers for some change in the user interface,there is almost always a function that the event calls upon to effect thechange. At least this appears to be the case with respect to Java.</p>                  <p>I think this is terribly important from the point of view of accessibility.In the past, and even today in some cases, adaptive technology achieves its goals by <em>simulating</em>events. To be concrete: if users save a document by typing &quot;control-s&quot;,then the adaptive technology achieves the same result by simulating the control-skey press. To be even more concrete:  suppose the user employs a voice recognition systemas their adaptive technology.  The user intones "save document", and thevoice recognition device turns around and simulates theappropriate key press so that save-document functionality is engaged in theword processor it is controlling.</p>             <p>This is silly -- if the point is to save a document, then invoke theapplication's save function. Similarly, for other functions of the application.  Now, this is not the fault of people who develop adaptive technology.  Ithas worked this way, because, in general, <em>it had to</em>. There was nodirect access to an application's functionality.</p>        <p>This is improving -- witness the Java platform. From a distance, youcan think of adaptive technology as a kind of scripting. If applications publishedtheir capabilites for outside agents to use, then the agents can direct theapplication through means other than a mouse and keyboard. The agents <em>nolonger simulate events</em> to manage the application. They simply tell theapplication what to do.</p>  </dd></dl><hr><p>Copyright &copy; 2002 Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University ofToronto.<br>Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article is permitted in anymedium, provided this notice is preserved.</p><p>Web site maintained by Joseph Scheuhammer<br>Updated: 04 Nov 2012</p></body></html>
