A major reason for its creation was theseparation of &quot;data&quot; from &quot;presentation&quot; in order to makedocuments portable and platform independent.  This document discusses thedata/presentation dichotomy with an eye towards its relevance to accessibility.</P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>The main reason for XML is to separate clearly &quot;data&quot; from &quot;presentation&quot;,or, to put it another way, create portable textual data.  Portable, structuredtext was the original intent of HTML:  As an instance of SGML, the idea behindHTML was to develop a set of elements that would define the structure of a a webdocument.  But, as HTML matured, the wrong kinds of elements were added whosepurpose was entirely format oriented.</P><P>This paper refers to the data/presentation distinction in the vernacular &quot;content&quot;vs. &quot;form&quot;.  In order to get a feel of what the difference is,consider the sentence, &quot;The sun is shining&quot;.  The <EM>content</EM> ofthat sentence says something about a celestial object, and has implicationsabout the weather.  But, that content is distinct from how it is presented --one could easily re-<EM>format</EM> it in bold face for emphasis (e.g.,<SPAN CLASS="boldSun">&quot;The sun is shining&quot;</SPAN>), or perhaps in red(e.g.,<SPAN CLASS="redSun">&quot;The sun is shining&quot;</SPAN>).  In all threecases, the content remains the same, but is displayed in different textualformats.</P><P>The development of XML began from the premise that form and content shouldbe decoupled, and that XML would be used primarily to encode content.   Whilemention is made in this document of XML, most of the discussion will centrearound form and content, and how that relates to accessibility.</P><P>From the point of view of accessibility, the main reason to promote theseparation of content from form is that it has the potential to ease, and insome cases, solve, problems of accessibility.  When content is clearly distinctfrom its format, the self-same content can be presented in numerous ways. Consider that a standard problem of accessibility is:  how does one acquire andpresent information to persons with disabilities?  To take a concrete example,how does one take information presented in a visual medium to a blind person? The answer is implied by the question:  it is the<EM>medium</EM> that is visual, not the information.  Or, to put it anotherway, the information content is one thing, and the means of its presentation,another.  Once one has gained unequivocal access to the content, that contentcan be presented via a variety of media.   But, in order to do this, is itrequisite that the content clearly be separated from its format.</P><H2>We are all blind</H2><P>To paraphrase Professor Gregg Vanderheiden, of the TRACE centre, Universityof Wisconsin:  &quot;There are two kinds of blind people; those who can't see,and those who can&quot;.  This apparent self contradictory statement was made ata discussion panel at W8, the eighth annual conference of the world wide web. Half of the panel were people interested in, and working towards, making the webaccessible.  The other half of the panel were people who designed userinterfaces for mobile devices.  Such devices are limited in their screen size,and are manipulated by pressing buttons on a keypad.  It is a challenge, to saythe least, to present web content on such a device, and allow meaningfulinteractions with it.  Vanderheiden was making the point that when driving thespeed limit down a four lane highway, it is highly undesirable that the driverpay much visual or motor attention to their cell phone.  They should be lookingat the road, with both hands firmly on the wheel.  In such a scenario, thedriver is effectively blind.</P><P>The real point here is that the problem of accessibility is a universal one. It is not relevant just in the case of people with disabilities.  The problemof how to provide access to information, say for a blind person, frequentlyresembles the more general problem of how to provide access to information inother limiting contexts. The problems are the same.</P><P>Here are two ways of describing the benefits of separating form fromcontent, one specifically with regard to accessibility, the other, with respectto a general user interface issue.  I leave it to the reader as to whether theseare precisely identical.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>From an accessibility point of view, there is a need to designhypermedia content in a way that allows someone with a disability (e.g., blind)to interact easily with that media.</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>From a general interface point view, there is a need to designhypermedia content in a way that allows it to be presented on a variety ofdifferent devices, with different capabilities.</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE><H2>Solution:  Separate Form from Content</H2><P>Part of the solution to both of these problems is the clean separation ofform from content. Furthermore, if accessibility is simply a special instance ofa universal problem, then the separation of form and content should benefit all.  This section discusses the ideas of form and content in greater detail, andwhy separating them is a Good Thing<SPAN CLASS="trademark">TM</SPAN>.</P><H3>What is Content?</H3><P>It was noted earlier that HTML began as a content markup language, whosepurpose was to delineate the text of a document according to its logicalstructure.  This is exemplified by the header elements, H1 through H6.  As anexample, here are two such elements, first as they appear in the markup,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;H1&gt;This is a header level one&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2&gt;This is a header level two&lt;/H2&gt;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>and then as they appear in a web browser:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H1>This is a header level one</H1><H2>This is a header level two</H2></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The different heading texts are formatted using different font sizes,weight, centred vs. flush left, and so on.  But, if you look at the tag, all itreally indicates is that text within is a heading. The different types of headerspecify levels of importance -- <CODE>H1</CODE> is a major header, <CODE>H2</CODE>is a sub-header, and so on.  The <CODE>Hn</CODE> tag does not say anythingremotely as specific as, &quot;render the text as 18 point bold&quot;. That is,the element says nothing about how the text it surrounds is displayed.  Instead,header elements declare the headings or major sections of the text, which is alogical kind of markup.  These elements do not say anything about how that textappears.</P><P>This is good because it forestalls inferences.  That is, by beingnon-committal in terms of how the text will look, the markup states only thecategory that the text belongs to.  This allows one to build devices that aresensitive to such categories even in cases where format is a irrelevant. However, if the markup goes further, and does specify the exact format, then thecategory information is only implicit, and it becomes more difficult to recoverit.  It must be inferred from the format, and that inference may not always besound.</P><P>Unfortunately, over the course of its development, people insisted on addingelements to HTML for purely formatting reasons.</P><H3>What is Format?</H3><P>Initially, there were a pair of HTML elements whose purpose was to indicatethat some portion of the text required emphasis; and this pair of elementsallowed for two degrees of emphasis.  The elements in question are the <CODE>EM</CODE>and <CODE>STRONG</CODE> elements.  At a later stage, the elements for italicand bold text were added; these are the <CODE>I</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>elements.  Here is an example of all of them, again as straight markup,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;EM&gt;This is emphasized text.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is strongly emphasized text.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;I&gt;This is italic text.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt;This is bold text.&lt;/B&gt;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>and as rendered text:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>This is emphasized text.</EM><BR><STRONG>This is strongly emphasizedtext.</STRONG><BR><I>This is italic text.</I><BR><B>This is bold text.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Now, the <CODE>I</CODE> element means, &quot;render as italic text&quot;;and the <CODE>B</CODE> element, &quot;render as bold&quot;.  Obviously, theseare both formatting commands.  However, a glance at the <CODE>EM</CODE> and<CODE>STRONG</CODE> elements reveals that they are also rendered as italic andbold, respectively.  What is the difference?</P><P>The difference is that if the markup is <CODE>EM</CODE> or <CODE>STRONG</CODE>,then the text is declared as requiring emphasis, but <EM>only</EM> that.  Itdoes not go further to declare <EM>how</EM> the text should be emphasized.  Onthe other hand, while using <CODE>I</CODE> or <CODE>B</CODE> does emphasizethe text, it does so in a purely visual way.  &quot;Italic&quot; or &quot;bold&quot;are type setting directives for printed versions of the text.  What if themarkup were passed to a voice synthesizer to speak the text?  How does one speaktext that is bold?  Using <CODE>B</CODE> commits one to a specific way ofrendering the text, specifically, a visual one; when, what is really desired isa declaration that this text is <EM>somehow</EM> different and to allow theexpression of that difference to vary depending on the medium in which it isrendered.  Indeed, even within a medium, there may be constraints, such asscreen real estate, that alter how emphasized text can be drawn.  Thus, the useof <CODE>EM</CODE> and <CODE>STRONG</CODE> elements is superior in the sensethat they describe the content without committing it to a specific format.</P><H2>Style Sheets</H2><P>Okay, so we have all agreed to use only elements of HTML, and in the future,XML, that declare the structure and content of our documents.  Still, we do wantto present them somehow, perhaps on a desktop personal computer, or a mobilephone, or both.  In either case, we are forced ultimately to render the documentsomehow, and to format that content in some way.  How can this be done?  Betterstill, how can the same markup be rendered in completely different ways?</P><P>The short answer is: style sheets.  Style sheets are companion documents,that reside in files separate from the content, that describe how that contentis to be rendered.  There are a number of style sheet solutions in the works;here I will describe (briefly) the notion of cascading style sheets (CSS).</P><P>CSS are essentially declarations of the style (font, size, etc.) toassociate with different elements of the markup.  The style can be &quot;global&quot;in the sense that the style sheet declares how all elements of a certain typeare to be rendered.  For example, it could declare that all <CODE>EM</CODE>elements be rendered in an italic face.  Or the style can be minutely &quot;local&quot;in that a specific instance of a element be rendered in a certain way.  CSS isvery flexible, and, by using them, one can make one's HTML documents exceedinglyrich, without sacrificing the specification of those documents' content.</P><P>As an example, here is the beginning of a document that uses CSS in theextreme to present a set of paragraphs in different fonts, sizes, andoverlapping one another in various ways.

In other words, noformat specific HTML elements are used in the markup of the document since theformat information is taken from separate style documents.  Furthermore, usingstyle sheets increases the likelihood that the document content will beaccessible, since that content is readily available. An audio presentation ofthe content, for example, can simply ignore the visual style sheets asirrelevant and recite the content appropriately.  And, it can do so because thecontent is now separate from its format.</P><P>Still, if it is possible to provide visual style information separate fromsome content, why not provide the analogous audio styles?  In point of fact, anaudio CSS specification has been developed.  In this case, the style sheets givedirectives on how to vary the presentation of content when using an audiomedium.  Here is an example section of an audio style sheet that describes howto present headings and paragraphs:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 {	voice-family: paul;	stress: 20;	richness: 90;	cue-before: url(&quot;ping.au&quot;)}P.heidi { azimuth: center-left }P.peter { azimuth: right }P.goat  { volume: x-soft }</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>According to this fragment of the style sheet, all heading text is to bespoken with the voice &quot;paul&quot;.  This designates a specific voice on asynthesizer, much like a font family does in the case of the visual formattingof text.  The stress level is to be &quot;20&quot;, which means that the voiceshould stress heading text more than compared to other, &quot;plain&quot; text. The richness style indicates how monotone the voice should be; here it is set tobe non-monotone.  Finally, before speaking a heading, the renderer is directedto play a ping sound effect, providing another cue that the text is a heading.</P><P>With respect to the presentation of paragraphs, there are three specifickinds classified as &quot;heidi&quot;, &quot;peter&quot;, and &quot;goat&quot;. These are in addition to standard vanilla paragraphs. Paragraphs of type &quot;heidi&quot;should sound like they are coming from slightly left of centre, whereas &quot;peter&quot;paragraphs should come from the far right.  Paragraphs of type &quot;goat&quot;should be spoken extra quietly.</P><P>A complete audio style sheet would, of course, specify the audio styles forall the content elements.  It is hoped that this fragment will give the reader asense of how such styles could be employed to express the content of an HTMLdocument using an audio medium.

By using structural markup exclusively todelineate sections of one's documents, and avoiding the use of any formatmarkup, there is a greater opportunity to deploy that content in a widercontext, be it desktop personal computers, smaller hand held devices, orintermediate sized internet appliances.  The use of style sheets permits thepresentation of the same content in this variety of contexts, and,simultaneously opens the door to alternative interfaces for those withdisabilities.</P><HR><P>Copyright &copy; 2000 Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University ofToronto.</P><P>Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article is permitted in anymedium, provided this notice is preserved.</P><P>Updated: 2000 Jul 07 JS</P><P>Web site maintained by<A HREF="mailto:clown.scheuhammer@utoronto.ca">Joseph Scheuhammer</A></P></BODY></HTML>
