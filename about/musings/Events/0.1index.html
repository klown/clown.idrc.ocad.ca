One way to conceive human-computer interaction is view the computeras waiting for the user to &quot;do something&quot;, and, based what the userhas done, execute some feature of the currently running application.  By &quot;dosomething&quot; is meant, move the mouse to some user interface element andclick on it, or move keyboard focus to some element, and press a key.  The actsof moving the mouse, clicking the mouse, and pressing keys are termed &quot;events&quot;herein.  However, I wish to notify the reader at the outset that I do not seeevents as only ocurring within the user interface.  Primarily, that is where thediscussion will focus, but events do happen outside of that context, and remain,nonetheless, events in their essential character.</P><P>Events are classified generally into two categories.  These are designatedalternatively as low-level vs. high-level, external vs. internal, or physicalvs. semantic.  The dichotomy is intended to distinguish between events that arecaused by a hardware device such as a mouse; hence &quot;physical&quot;, &quot;external&quot;,and &quot;low-level&quot;; or a programmatic event, such as a window appearingon screen; hence &quot;internal&quot;, &quot;semantic&quot;, or &quot;high-level&quot;. I prefer the low vs. high level nomenclature since it captures the ideas ofabstraction and equivalence classes.  That is, a low level event is a singularkind of thing, whereas a high level event is defined by abstracting over anumber of low level events and classifying them as the same thing.</P><P>Take, for example, the idea of &quot;dialing&quot; a telephone.  Thisconcept has its roots in old-fashioned rotary phones where one rotated a dial inorder to place a call.  Today, most telephones are touch-tone, and one places acall by pushing a sequence of buttons.  Or, consider a situation where nophysical interface is needed; for example, when a modem makes a call bygenerating a sequence of tones.  In all three cases, we refer to the event as &quot;dialing&quot;the number.  What has happened is that the act of placing the call has becomecentral to the concept, and the actual motions used to perform that act are lessimportant or irrelevant.  Another way of putting this is to say that rotating adial, pushing buttons, or generating tones form an equivalence class thatabstracts away from the minute details of performing the act.</P><P>The same can be said for computer user interface events.  Clicking on abutton, moving keyboard focus to that button and hitting return, or evenspeaking the button's label can all be said to amount to the same thing; namely,activating the function of that button.</P></BODY></HTML>
