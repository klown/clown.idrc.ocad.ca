I did my Bachelor and  Master of Arts degrees at the<A HREF="http://www.uwo.ca/" TITLE="University of Western Ontario">Universityof Western Ontario</A>.  My undergraduate was a double major in philosophy andpsychology.</P><P>In obtaining a Master of Arts, I subjected faculty, staff, and students tohours of looking and pointing at various 2d shapes while peering through lensesthat reduced their apparent size. The reasons for the research were:  (1)previous studies had found that adaptation to minification was difficult toachieve, and (2) to investigate whether the adaptation was purely visual orinvolved the motor system.  The results were published, and if you are reallyinterested, go look for them in:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Scheuhammer J., Timney B. 1982 &quot;Adaptation to Optically Reduced Size&quot;<I>Perception</I>,  <B>11</B>, 139-152.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>After the MA I journeyed to the East Pole and took up with the thenPsychology department at the<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/" TITLE="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MassachusettsInstitute of Technology</A>.  By the time I finished, the department had changedits name; thus, I have a Ph.D. in &quot;<AHREF="http://web-bcs.mit.edu/" TITLE="Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences">Brainand Cognitive Sciences</A>&quot;.  For my Ph.D. I investigated how edges thatended were perceived. The title of the thesis was &quot;Contour Completion atEdge Endings&quot;.</P><P>In the process of doing the research, I learned how to coerce (i.e. program)a Unix box to display a variety of visual stimuli.  I decided that programmingwas more fulfilling than psychophysical research, so when I finished the degree,I sought employment as a programmer.</P><H2>Employment.</H2><P>Upon graduating from MIT, and returning to Canada, I joined a then newcompany named Discis Knowledge Research, Inc.  They have since gone intoreceivership, but if you do a web search, I'm sure you will find a link or two.</P><P>Our first product line was information rich versions of children's books onCD-ROM, whose purpose was to help children learn to read.  For example, clickingon a word in the text elicitted its pronunciation, an oral context specificdefinition of the word, and a second language explanation.  Clicking onpictorial elements invoked a label of the pictured item, a pronunciation of theitem, and a second language explanation.  Clicking on a speaker icon at thebeginning of a sentence cause that sentence to be read while it was hilightedphrase-by-phrase.  We first released product in the summer of 1990.  Examples oftitles include Beatrix Potter's &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; and RobertMunsch's &quot;The Paper Bag Princess&quot;</P><P>The production system for these titles ran on Macintosh computers, althoughthe end product can run on either Mac or Windows.  I was responsible fordeveloping parts of the production system; thus, I was gradually weaned awayfrom Unix, and towards the Macintosh platform.</P><P>After eight years at Discis, I decided to move on, and am now a member ofthe<AHREF="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc" TITLE="The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre">AdaptiveTechnologies Research Centre</A>  at the<A HREF="http://www.utoronto.ca/" TITLE="The University of Toronto">Universityof Toronto</A>, where I design and implement adaptive interfaces for internetapplications.  I have since migrated away from the Macintosh and now favour theJava platform.  Mind you, I still use a Mac for all of my development.</P><H2>Personal.</H2><P>I am married to Judy and we have a son, Alistair, and a catnamed Isaac.</P><P>Hobbies and other interests include fantasy role playing games, jogging,juggling, and piano.</P><HR><P>Back to<AHREF="index.html" TITLE="Joseph Scheuhammer">Joseph'shome page</A>.</P></BODY></HTML>
