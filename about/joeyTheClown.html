It depicts a clown's head that sort of, kind ofresembles me.  The clown wears a conical hat with a puff ball at its peak, andis smiling.</P><H2>Yes, but why &quot;clown&quot;?</H2><P>People ask me this question frequently.  I get the feeling that they thinkthere is some deep, exciting reason.  After I tell them the story, theirreaction is tinged with disappointment.  It isn't at all earth shattering.</P><H2>OK, but tell me anyway.</H2><P>My brother once gave me a coffee mug for my birthday.  It had on it acartoon-ish picture of a clown.  The clown is juggling and it holds a squeezehorn from which emanates the word &quot;Honk&quot;.  There are words wrappedaround the rim spelling out &quot;Joey the Clown&quot;.  My brother thought itan amusing joke gift.  I nearly dented his head with it.</P><P>At first, I used that mug privately, as it were.  Once, because it wasconvenient, I took  it to a  seminar -- I was a graduate student at the time. The person sitting across from me was involved in a serious verbal exchange withthe prof when she saw the mug for the first time.  Oh, she had seen that I had amug of tea in front of me from the time I sat down, but her mind had decided atthat particular moment to register the words and picture thereon.  She valiantlytried to keep her dialogue serious, but numerous inappropriate smiles keptsneaking in.  The looks of puzzlement on the prof's face as he tried toreconcile her non-verbal cues to what she was saying...that was worth the priceof admission.</P><P>From that day on, that mug went with me to every class, seminar, colloquiam,and spontaneous doughnut council.</P><P>And it came to pass that I needed a Unix account.  The system administratorwas a friend of mine who was familiar with the mug.  It was he who dubbed my newaccount with the username &quot;clown&quot;, and I've been &quot;clown&quot;ever since.  By the way, he is truly a Unix wizard, calling himself &quot;magi&quot;(his last name is &quot;Wiseman&quot; -- no joke).</P><H2>A Sad Ending</H2><P>Alas, the mug is no more.  It slipped from my grasp and shattered into sixor seven pieces some years past.  From time to time, I seek another in finechina shops, and novelty gift stores, but I have yet to find the same design. In fact, I haven't even come close.  If you would care to help, here is a clue: the bottom is marked &quot;Staffordshire Potteries Ltd.  Ironstone.  Made inEngland&quot;.
