Let me start again: There was this brilliant mathematics student in the office next to mine
who used to come charging into my office, and, using my whiteboard, frenetically outline some
obscure, but new, finding in advanced mathematics. I would nod my head sagely (and at the
appropriate times, for the most part), and that seemed to make him happy. Eventually satisifed
that he had successfully disseminated some <a href=#pearls title="Not to be confused with pearls of wisdom.">gems of knowledge<span class="sup">1</span></a>, he would return to his corner of
the world.

<p>
Once, when I was trying to ignore him most studiously, he drew this caricature of me. Actually,
it's quite good, and (at the risk of sounding maudlin) I am pleased to add it to my main web page.
